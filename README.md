Tetris is a [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) implementation of the popular game [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) using the [GDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface) API part of [Win32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API#Win32).

**Note:** This implementation was done in an ASAP type of fashion. There is no good architecture, there are bugs, anti-patterns and lack of best practices rittle the whole ordeal. I would suggest **not** to read the source code, or and would prefer if you did not base your opinion on me based on the code in there. This is not of production grade quality, at all.
